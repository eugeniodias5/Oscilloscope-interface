# Technologies
It was used the Intel Quartus Software for building the Verilog code and loading it to the FPGA. The FPGA used was the Intel's Altera DE2-115.

# About
An user interface that allows us to generate waves at an oscilloscope. Using the FPGA's LCD and buttons, the user chooses the format of the wave, between a square wave, a triangle wave and a sine wave. After that, the user chooses the frequency of the wave and the digital signal correspondant is generated. The maximum frequency stipulated is 10MHz. The signals are more precise for lower frequencies. Then whe use the FPGA's digital-analogic conversor and output the analogic signal using a VGA cable to transmit it. To finish, we get the wave at the oscilloscope for the analogic signal outputted by the VGA cable.
